# Roblox Profile Alt Checker

## Description
The Roblox Profile Alt Checker is a browser extension that helps users determine if a Roblox account is a main account or an alternative (alt) account. It does this by analyzing the user's profile and providing an alt percentage score directly on the Roblox profile page.

## Features
- Retrieves and displays an alt percentage score on Roblox profile pages.
- Easy to use with automatic fetching of user ID from the profile URL.
- Integrates seamlessly into the Roblox user interface, enhancing the user experience.
- Shows user activity based on badges
- Shows last time the user was online

## Model Info
- Current alt detection model has 15 inputs, roughly 80% less false positives than the last model based on the testing set.

## Api Docs
- WIP, I do intend to make this api accessible for game developers to filter out alts

### Supported Browsers
- Google Chrome (Manifest v3)
- Firefox (Manifest v2)
